README

This source code is for a few things for a model of the evolution of the mutation rate:
1. Numerically simulates the model.
2. Stores the numerical data from model runs to hdf5 files.
3. Simulates or solves simplified models for comparison to the full model.
4. Analyzes the data output by the model using statistics, graphs, etc.
